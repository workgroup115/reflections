When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When I'm collaborating with other people in a project or when I want to back up my local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	There could be conflicts Git would not know how to resolve. Besides, I'm aware of the changes I'm pulling, since the first moment.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	A fork is a copy of a repository I don't have permission to modify.
	A clone is a local copy of a remote repository.
	A branch is a place where I can experiment on new features in my code that are not part of the oficial version.

What is the benefit of having a local copy of the last known state of the remote store locally?
	The first thing that comes to my mind is that we have a back up of the remote branch. Next, we have an up-to-date version that contains all the changes made to the remote branch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or Github? What would be easier and what would be harder?
	Easier: Using a file hosting system, like dropbox.
	Harder: Passing files via usb.
